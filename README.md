# Recycle Bits
This project earned second place at Globant's Hack The Now And Next: AI Edition hackathon. Built by five team members, Recycle Bits utilizes Microsoft Cognititive Services' image-processing algorithms to determine whether an object in a user-submitted image is recyclable or not.

## The Idea
In an effort to encourage more people to recycle, we decided to build a program that allows users to upload a screenshot of an object and receive feedback regarding material composition and whether or not it's recyclable. A profile system allows users to track their recycling habits and compare themselves with friends, making recycling an engaging activity.

On the back-end, a Microsoft Azure API has been trained with hundreds of images to recognize recyclables with a great degree of accuracy.

## Programming
